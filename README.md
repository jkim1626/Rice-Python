Hi, everyone!
This is my code (homework and assignments) for COMP-140 (Introduction to Python Programming) at Rice University. 
Each module is divided into homework assignments and a final project. 
Many of the files require running on the Rice University IDE: py3.codeskulptor.org
The breakdown of concepts in each module and descriptions of each final project: 

Module 1
  Concepts: Variables, Expressions, Functions
  Project: Given three points, calculate the center and radius of a circle that passes through all three points

Module 2
  Concepts: Strings, Conditionals, Lists, Tuples, Iterations
  Project: Spot it! Interactive game where you try and find the common image between two groups of images 

Module 3
  Concepts: Dictionaries, Markov Chains, Random Library
  Project: Stock Predictor using Markov Chains

Module 4
  Concepts: OOP, Classes, Sets, Queues, BFS, Objects & References
  Project: Kevin Bacon Game (Using BFS to connect various actors based on movies they both acted in)
  
Module 5
  Concepts: QR codes, binary, copying/immutability, Z256 numbers.
  Project: QR Code generator and TicTacToe game
  
Module 6
  Concepts: Optimization Problems, I/O, Linear Algebra, Gradient Descent
  Project: Baseball game predictor model using LASSO regression
  
Module 7
  Concepts: Recursion, DFS, A* Search, Inheritance
  Project: Map Search. Given a start and end point on a map in Dallas, use DFS, BFS, and A* search algorithms to find the shortest path.
